            <p>As far as projects go, I have done a decent amount
                of them but I don't have any on GitHub. So I have
                no links to show for my projects.

                    <h4>Wordle</h4>
                    <p>Wordle is probably my favorite project
                        that I've done! I used Java Swing to
                        make my own wordle game. It had full
                        functionality and could store the user's
                        scores and high score.
                    </p>
                </li>

                    <h4>Formatter</h4>
                    <p>This project would take in an array of 
                        random generated numbers and change them
                        into base format, decimal-seperated format,
                        and accounting format. It took quite a bit
                        of time.
